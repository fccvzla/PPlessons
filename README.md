# Pair Programming Lessons Guide/Index

The main reason for this repository to exist is create a knowledge base, that
works as guidance to people who wants to introduce themselves to programming and
web development.

We will also try to share tools that improves the **accessibility** for all
members who do not have permanent internet connection or good hardware.

It is well known that there are not a real path to learn programming but this
guide/index aims to cover simple topics and encourage people to learn basic
concepts with others while solving simple exercises in our pair programming
meetings.

## How to participate in our Pair Programming meetings

We will try to schedule a pair programming exercise every week,
free to join to all the participants in our Telegram group:
